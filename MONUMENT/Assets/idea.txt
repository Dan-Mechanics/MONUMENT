attach concrete mat to script and then control it based on fricking actions.
or like blend between two materials.

add brackeys concrete texture.

also plan andrea playtest in.

we need to implement better tower system
en add the shadow figure and fix the jumping between the yeets.
perhaps we need to add an interaction.

and also fix the concrete texture a little.

next thing to add is that the monument blocks the player and that there is a shadow figure of past player.

my main question is what mechanci should i add now?
and i also really dont feel like this project atm.

maybe if i had some cool game art ..

i need an it factor mechanic QUIKC.
WAITER ONE IT FACTOR MECHANIC !!

what if the plaeyr had to use sound to find something?
wtf even is our concept.

in destroying the monument you learn its lore basically.

it factor mechanic could be sound.

i think the audio queues idea is good because you have to really
listen, but it has literally nothing to do with the concept.

maybe its like if the player is in contact with pillar
they have a massive jump boost.

idea: have cute plants on the outside.

next thing i wanna add is the sound or at least make da sound.

you can also add the black bars in.
